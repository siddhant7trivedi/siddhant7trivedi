<h1> Hi, I’m Siddhant 👋 </h1>

I lead cross-functional teams to build and ship AI-powered products from idea to production.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of AI, delivery, and business outcomes. I focus on turning ambiguous AI ideas into production-ready MVPs, aligning product, engineering, design, and stakeholders to deliver real impact — not experiments that never ship.

I use GitHub to document real AI products, delivery frameworks, and execution playbooks — systems that were planned, built, and shipped in production.


**What I work on**
- AI Product Delivery: MVP → production launches for AI-powered products under tight timelines
- ML / LLM Enablement: Operationalizing LLM-powered copilots with defined inference workflows, evaluation metrics, and human-in-the-loop controls
- Program & Delivery Leadership: Agile / SAFe execution, sprint planning, capacity & velocity management across large cross-functional teams
- AI Systems at Scale: Enterprise AI systems, conversational platforms, and RAG-based solutions with monitoring and governance
- Execution & Impact: Shipping AI products used at scale, improving time-to-market, predictability, and reliability


<h2> About Me </h2>
